                <h5>what is difference between local storage and session storage?</h5>
                <p>So in session storage, the data is stored in the browser’s memory for that specific session. Session more here means until you close the browser window. Unlike cookies, the data in sessionStorage is never transferred to the server while making a network request.   The storage limit of session storage is also very high when compared to cookies. The cookies which can generally store around 4000 bytes of data here session storage can store at least 5 MB of data or even more than that depending on the device and browser. Which is a lot!</p>

                  <p>If we talk about localStorage, it is almost the same as the session storage but the major difference is that it does not have an expiry. So Even if you close the browser and restart your system and come back again anytime the data persists. That makes it unique and very useful. And among these 3, localStorage has higher memory limit.

                    It’s used a lot even by many big companies to store some less relevant user-specific data into their browsers. Some companies even use it to optimize the performance of the web page speed as access localStorage is faster than making a request to the server and getting the data.</p>

                <h5> what is difference between local storage and session storage?</h5>
                <p><strong>The Global scope:</strong>A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.</p>

                  <p><strong>The Block scope:</strong>
                    So far, we’ve seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.</p>

                <h5> how does javascript event loop work? </h5>
                <p>The event loop is offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible, and allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations. Most modern kernels are multi-threaded (they can handle multiple operations at the same time). When one of these kernel operations completes, Node.js gets an update (from the Kernel), so a callback gets added to the poll queue to be eventually executed.</p>

                <h5> How many ways to get undefined? </h5>
                <p>Any expression where a fraction looks like this: x/0 is an undefined expression. Likewise, if there is a polynomial in the denominator, such as 1/x, the expression is undefined when x=0.</p>
